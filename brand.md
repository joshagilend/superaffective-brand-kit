# Here's the deal

I, Josh Stroud, give you permission to use my brand for whatever you want. You can post it, you can run it, you can save it, you can scan it - you can toast it, you can pop it, you can lock it, you can drop it. 

You can use it for anything. It's free. No problem. We agree. We sign on the dotted line. The lawyers approve it. No lawsuits. No copyright infringement. 

We promise we will never sue anyone for using our brand. We don't care. We'll block you on Facebook, but we won't sue :)

Everything is open source. We give back. We believe in open source brands. I learned about it in my MA at Sofia University, and I stand by it today.
