# Here's the deal

I, Josh Stroud, give you permission to use my brand for whatever you want. You can post it, you can run it, you can save it, you can scan it - you can toast it, you can pop it, you can lock it, you can drop it. 

You can use it for anything. It's free. No problem. We agree. We sign on the dotted line. The lawyers approve it. No lawsuits. No copyright infringement.
